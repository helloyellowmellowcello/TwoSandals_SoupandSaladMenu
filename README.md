# Inclusive Interviews
<strong>Description</strong><br />
For coding help with my Codecademy UI project

<strong>About</strong><br />
This repository contains my working files for one of the UI projects with the Codecademy Intensive Pro: Building UIs course.<br />
It is for obtaining suggestions, corrections and coding help from my course-mates and facilitator.<br /><br />
No reproduction of the HTML & CSS code outside of the abovementioned context is allowed. 
While the basic bare-bones webpage content was produced by Codecademy, the majority of the styling and HTML structure and syntax have been modified by me with kind assistance from my course facilitator and instuctor, Jim.<br />
Kindly approach Codecademy to obtain the base template.

<strong>The Brief</strong><br />
You've been hired by ​Inclusive Interviews​ to redesign their webpage. ​Inclusive Interviews​ is an  online publication that focuses on the interview format as a way to uplift the experiences and  celebrate the successes of diverse professional voices. After conducting some research, they  believe that updating their online presence would help them expand their audience.
